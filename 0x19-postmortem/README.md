Issue Summary:

Duration of the Outage: June 4, 2024, 11:00 AM - June 4, 2024, 1:30 PM (UTC)
Impact: The maze game application was unresponsive, preventing users from starting new games and continuing existing ones. Users experienced loading failures and crashes when interacting with the game. Approximately 95% of users were affected, causing frustration and potential loss of user interest.
Root Cause: A bug in the maze generation algorithm caused excessive CPU usage, leading to application freezes and crashes.
Timeline:
11:00 AM: Issue detected by a personal test showing the application freezing during maze generation.
11:05 AM: Initial assumption was a memory leak in the application due to high memory consumption observed.
11:20 AM: Conducted a thorough review of recent code changes, focusing on memory management.
11:45 AM: Misleading investigation into the graphical rendering component consumed time but was ruled out.
12:00 PM: Isolated the problem to the maze generation algorithm after extensive debugging.
12:30 PM: Discovered inefficient recursive logic in the algorithm causing CPU overload.
1:00 PM: Optimized the maze generation algorithm to reduce CPU usage.
1:15 PM: Tested the fix in a local environment, confirming the issue was resolved.
1:30 PM: Deployed the optimized algorithm and verified the application was stable.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:
The outage was caused by an inefficient maze generation algorithm that used excessive CPU resources. The algorithm employed deep recursion without proper optimization, leading to significant CPU strain and resulting in application freezes and crashes when generating complex mazes.

Resolution:
The resolution involved optimizing the maze generation algorithm to improve its efficiency. The following steps were taken:

Identify the Inefficient Algorithm: Pinpointed the section of the code responsible for maze generation.
Optimize Recursive Logic: Rewrote the algorithm to use an iterative approach instead of deep recursion, significantly reducing CPU usage.
Implement Caching: Added caching mechanisms to store previously computed maze segments, minimizing redundant computations.
Test and Validate: Conducted extensive testing to ensure the optimized algorithm worked correctly and efficiently.
Deploy the Fix: Implemented the optimized algorithm in the live environment and monitored performance.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:

Algorithm Review: Regularly review and optimize algorithms to ensure they are efficient and scalable.
Resource Monitoring: Implement comprehensive monitoring of CPU and memory usage to detect and address performance issues promptly.
Load Testing: Perform regular load testing to identify potential performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
Task List:

Code Review: Conduct a detailed code review focusing on computational efficiency and resource management.
Add Monitoring: Implement monitoring tools to track CPU and memory usage during maze generation.
Refactor Algorithm: Continuously refactor and optimize algorithms to improve performance.
Document Changes: Document the changes made to the maze generation algorithm and the reasons for these changes.
Implement Automated Testing: Develop automated tests to ensure the maze generation algorithm performs efficiently under various conditions.

Conclusion:
This outage emphasized the importance of efficient algorithm design and resource management. By addressing the immediate issues and implementing preventive measures, we aim to enhance the stability and performance of the maze game platform and ensure a smooth user experience.
